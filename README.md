## Data repository

This repository contains two folders:

-   **Raw_data**: This folder contains the acquisitions recorded with the EMG recording system during four experiments: Hand, Autonomous Control, Discrete Control, and Continuous Control. Each subject has two files:
    
    -   `user#_controlModality.mat`: Contains the EMG recording data and related details.
    -   `user#_controlModality.m`: Contains timestamps of the stimuli and other additional information.
-   **Data**: This folder contains post-processed EMG data and questionnaire responses.
    
    -   `data.xlsx`: A table with computed values for each user across the four experiments.
    -   `VAS_results.xlsx`: Reports answers provided by participants in the post-experiment questionnaire.
    -   `latencyAndDuration.xlsx`: A table with computed values for each user across the four experiments regarding the latency and HBR duration.
